# Bank Customer Retention Analysis

## Project Overview

Loss of existing customers is a significant challenge for banks and other businesses, as it directly impacts profitability and long-term growth. Understanding the factors driving churn is crucial for developing targeted retention strategies that can enhance customer satisfaction and reduce attrition rates.

This project focuses on analyzing customer demographics, account features, and transactional behaviors using Microsoft Excel to uncover patterns associated with customers at risk of leaving the bank. By identifying these factors, we aim to provide actionable insights to help improve customer retention efforts.

## Key Objectives
